## Overview

This repository contains the official implementation of **Optimal Transport Warping (OTW)** for
**time-series classification**, developed as part of a Master’s thesis at Universität Koblenz.

The project focuses on:
- **GPU-accelerated Optimal Transport Warping (OTW)** using PyTorch and CUDA
- Comparison against **Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)**
- Evaluation on **7 datasets from the UCR Time Series Classification Archive**
- Real-world applications including **medical, energy, and traffic data**

The results demonstrate that OTW:
- Achieves **up to 70× faster computation** using GPU acceleration
- Produces **up to 60% lower classification error** compared to DTW on structurally complex datasets
